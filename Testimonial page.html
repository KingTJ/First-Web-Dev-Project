                            "TJ's Bistro is such an amazing restaurant. I come here at least three times a week to enjoy the delicious food.The customer service is excellent, the atmosphere here is welcoming, and most importaantly it feels like a family here. TJ loves customer interaction as well. It's good that a restaurant owner is so concerned and wants to to connect with his customers on a personal level." <i>Josh Smith</i>

                            "We wanted to host a nice network mixer for our employees and we needed a place that was affordable and reliable.TJ's Bistro didn't break the bank like many other establishments. They were very reliable and we were able to give our employees a friendly environmennt to mingle with each other. We will defeinitely be coming back here for all of our future network mixer events. The fact that TJ is there during the whole event puts our mind at ease when most places don't do that." <i>Benefactor LLC</i>

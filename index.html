                <p class="centp">
                    We are a premier restaurant that serves high quality food with the <em>freshest</em> ingridients. We also offer special accomodations and we hope that you will have a pleasureable experience. We offer casual lunch and dinner fare in a hip atmosphere. The restaurant is simple and elegant, refined and relaxed. You can wear jeans or a suit, you can drink beer or champagne. Truly, it is all about the food. This is food your mother would make if she were a classically trained chef. The cuisine is grounded yet manages to be interesting enough to demand multiple visits. Visiting this restaurant is like coming over to TJâ€™s house for dinner. Family is everywhere, welcoming you at the door, cooking your food, serving your drinks. The owner TJ visits as many tables as he can each evening, mostly to talk about the food.The menu changes regularly to highlight the freshest ingridients. Thank you for visiting our website!
